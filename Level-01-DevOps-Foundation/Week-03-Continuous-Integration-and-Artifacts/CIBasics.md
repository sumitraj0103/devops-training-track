Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. Each integration is automatically tested and built to detect errors quickly. This practice helps reduce integration problems, improve code quality, and speed up the development process
One of the primary benefits of adopting CI is that it will save you time during your development cycle by identifying and addressing conflicts early. It’s also a great way to reduce the amount of time spent on fixing bugs and regression by putting more emphasis on having a good test suite. Finally, it helps share a better understanding of the codebase and the features that you’re developing for your customers.
