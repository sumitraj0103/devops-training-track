# Deploying Securely in Production

## Gates
**Gates** in a Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline are crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of software before it progresses to the next stage. Here are some key points about their significance:

### Quality Assurance
* Automated Checks: Gates enforce automated checks that validate the code against predefined criteria, such as passing tests, code quality standards, and security scans1.
* Manual Approvals: In some cases, gates require manual approvals to ensure that critical changes are reviewed by a human before deployment1.
### Risk Mitigation
* Preventing Issues: Gates help prevent issues from reaching production by catching problems early in the pipeline2.
* Compliance: They ensure compliance with organizational policies and regulatory requirements by enforcing necessary checks3.

### Efficiency
* Streamlined Workflow: Gates automate the decision-making process, reducing the need for manual intervention and speeding up the delivery cycle2.
* Consistency: They maintain consistency across different environments by ensuring that only code meeting the required standards is deployed3.

### Examples of Gates
* Security Scans: Ensuring the code is free from vulnerabilities.
* Performance Tests: Validating that the application meets performance benchmarks.
* Approval Steps: Requiring sign-off from stakeholders before proceeding.
* Change Validation : Validating a change request status for approval.
  
By implementing gates, organizations can achieve a balance between rapid delivery and maintaining high standards of quality and security. If you have any specific questions about setting up gates in your pipeline, feel free to ask!
