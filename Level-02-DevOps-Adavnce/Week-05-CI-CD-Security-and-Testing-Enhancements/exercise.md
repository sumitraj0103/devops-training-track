## Topics Covered

- Adding security aspects to CI/CD pipelines.
- Including unit testing in the project scope.
- Integrating code quality and vulnerability checks.
- Implementing approval steps before deployment.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform and Checkov

1. **Setup Terraform**:
    - [ ] Create an Azure Resource Group.
    - [ ] Create an Azure Virtual Network (VNET).
    - [ ] Create a Log Analytics Workspace.
    - [ ] Create a Windows 2022 DC Virtual Machine.
    - Use one module from Microsoft verified modules [Link](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/).

2. **Run Checkov**:
    - [ ] Install and run [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/) to check for security issues in the Terraform code.
    - [ ] Integrate Checkov into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality.

### Exercise 2: Code Quality and Vulnerability Checks with SonarQube

1. **Setup SonarQube**:
    - [ ] Install and configure [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) to check for code quality and vulnerabilities.
    - [ ] Integrate SonarQube into the CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Run SonarQube**:
    - [ ] Run SonarQube analysis on the Terraform code to identify code quality issues and vulnerabilities.

### Exercise 3: CI/CD Pipeline with Approval Step

1. **Create CI/CD Pipeline**:
    - [ ] Create a CI/CD pipeline with the following stages:
        - **Stage 1: Scan & Build**
            - Jobs:
                - [ ] Checkov: Run Checkov to check for security issues in the code.
                - [ ] SonarQube: Run SonarQube to check for code quality and vulnerabilities in the code.
        - **Stage 2: Test**
            - Jobs:
                - [ ] Unit Test: Run unit tests to ensure the code is working as expected.
        - **Stage 3: Deploy**
            - Jobs:
                - [ ] Approval: Add an approval step before deploying the code to the production environment.
                - [ ] Terraform Apply: Deploy the code to the production environment.

2. **Integrate with Pull Requests**:
    - [ ] Configure the pipeline to run Checkov and SonarQube checks on pull requests before merging to the main branch.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites in place before starting:
1. [ ] An active Azure Subscription.
2. [ ] Access to Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline.
3. [ ] Service Connection to the Azure Subscription in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.
4. [ ] An active repository in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

### Main Sections

1. **Terraform** - Test with [Integration Test File](./assets/integration-testing/)
    - [ ] Execute the Terraform configuration files from your local machine.
    - [ ] Create a basic pipeline to execute it from Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

2. **Automated Testing** - Ensure code quality:
    - [ ] Install and run [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/) - A static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code.
    - [ ] Update the first stage to run Checkov - Add Checkov to the first stage of the pipeline to ensure code quality.
    - [ ] [Learn More](https://medium.com/@williamwarley/ensuring-iac-security-with-checkov-a-practical-integration-guide-for-azure-devops-gitlab-and-cc8bcfa3d3e9).

3. **Code Quality and Vulnerability Checks** - Integrate SonarQube:
    - [ ] Install and configure [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) to check for code quality and vulnerabilities.
    - [ ] Integrate SonarQube into the CI/CD pipeline.

4. **Approval Step** - Add an approval step before deployment:
    - [ ] Configure the pipeline to include an approval step before deploying the code to the production environment.
