## Topics Covered:
	Understanding Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for cloud infrastructure.
	Creating infrastructure using Terraform or similar tools.
## Exercises:
	Write IaC scripts to provision infrastructure on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
	Deploy a VM instance or Kubernetes cluster using Terraform.
	Test the deployment for accessibility and correctness.
### Introduction to IaC
- Definition and importance of IaC.
- Benefits of using IaC in cloud infrastructure management.
- Comparison with traditional infrastructure management.

### Key Concepts of IaC
- Declarative vs. imperative approaches.
- Version control for infrastructure.
- Reusability and modularity in IaC.

### Overview of Popular IaC Tools
- Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, Google Cloud Deployment Manager.
- Brief comparison of features and use cases.

### Exercise 1: Exploring IaC Tools
- **Hands-on with Terraform**: Install and configure Terraform.
- Write a simple Terraform script to create a basic infrastructure (e.g., an S3 bucket on AWS).

## Afternoon Session: Creating Infrastructure Using Terraform

### Deep Dive into Terraform
- Terraform architecture and workflow.
- Providers, resources, and modules.
- State management and state files.

### Writing Terraform Scripts
- Syntax and structure of Terraform configuration files.
- Variables and outputs.
- Managing dependencies and resource lifecycles.

### Deploying Infrastructure with Terraform
- Initializing and planning deployments.
- Applying and destroying infrastructure.
- Best practices for writing and organizing Terraform code.

### Exercise 2: Provisioning Infrastructure
- Write a Terraform script to provision a VM instance or a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
- Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform.
- Verify the deployment for accessibility and correctness.

## Wrap-Up and Q&A
- Recap of key concepts and exercises.
- Open floor for questions and discussion.
- Additional resources and next steps for further learning.

# Exercises Details

## Exercise 1: Exploring IaC Tools
- **Objective**: Get familiar with Terraform and its basic commands.
- **Task**: Install Terraform and write a script to create an S3 bucket on AWS.
- **Steps**:
  1. Install Terraform on your local machine.
  2. Configure AWS credentials.
  3. Write a Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) to create an S3 bucket.
  4. Initialize Terraform and apply the configuration.

## Exercise 2: Provisioning Infrastructure
- **Objective**: Provision a more complex infrastructure using Terraform.
- **Task**: Write and deploy a Terraform script to create a VM instance or a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Steps**:
  1. Choose a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
  2. Write a Terraform configuration file to create the chosen infrastructure.
  3. Initialize Terraform and plan the deployment.
  4. Apply the configuration and verify the deployment.
  5. Test the infrastructure for accessibility and correctness (e.g., SSH into the VM or access the Kubernetes cluster).
